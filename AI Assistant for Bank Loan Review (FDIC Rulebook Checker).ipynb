        "\n",

        "- Sets up an AI assistant specifically for analyzing loans under **FDIC RMS Manual – Section 3.2**.\n",
        "- Goal: Identify **compliance gaps, risks, and documentation issues**.\n",
        "- Ensures the AI focuses only on **regulatory guidance**, avoiding unrelated advice.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Key Prompting Techniques Used\n",
        "\n",
        "### a) Role Definition\n",
        "- AI is explicitly told its role: *Regulatory Loan Review Assistant*.\n",
        "- Limits AI to **examiner-style insights** rather than general advice.\n",
        "\n",
        "### b) Source Authority Restriction\n",
        "- AI must use **only FDIC Section 3.2**.\n",
        "- Ensures accuracy and regulatory compliance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### c) Operational Guidelines\n",
        "- Instructions focus on **risk classification, documentation review, and analysis**.\n",
        "- Queries outside Section 3.2 trigger a refusal.\n",
        "\n",
        "### d) Prohibited Actions\n",
        "- AI cannot provide **credit recommendations, legal advice, or speculation**.\n",
        "- Acts as a **safety guardrail**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### e) Tone and Style Specification\n",
        "- Neutral, professional, and clear communication.\n",
        "- Bullet points are preferred for clarity.\n",
        "- Makes outputs **examiner-ready**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### f) Focus Areas for Analysis\n",
        "- Well-defined loan weaknesses (e.g., missing amortization).\n",
        "- Adequacy of collateral and financial documentation.\n",
        "- Deviations from prudent underwriting practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Why This Prompting Technique Works\n",
        "- **Precision:** Narrow scope reduces irrelevant answers.\n",
        "- **Safety:** Prohibited actions prevent risky guidance.\n",
        "- **Clarity:** Tone and formatting ensure readability.\n",
        "- **Efficiency:** AI knows exactly what analysis is expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Real-World Application\n",
        "- Regulatory training, loan audits, and documentation review.\n",
        "- Helps examiners quickly identify **risk and compliance issues**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary\n",
        "This is an example of **role-based, scope-restricted, authority-constrained AI prompting**.  \n",
        "Clear instructions on source, behavior, tone, and focus turn the AI into a specialized assistant for **regulatory loan analysis**."
